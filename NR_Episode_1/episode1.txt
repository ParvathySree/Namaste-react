react.development.js:This version of React is intended for use during development.
It includes additional development-friendly features such as warning messages, helpful error messages, and readable code formatting.
The development version is larger in size compared to the production version due to the inclusion of these extra features.
It's beneficial for debugging and development purposes as it provides more detailed information about potential issues in your code.

react.production.js: This version of React is optimized for production use.
It excludes the development-specific features present in the development version, making it smaller and more lightweight.
By removing the development-specific code and optimizations, the production version helps reduce the file size and improve performance.
It's suitable for deploying your application to production environments where file size and performance are critical factors.

8.What are async and defer?

If async attribute is used in script tag , the html parsing and fetching scripts takes place parallely. Then html parsing pauses to execute the script.Once execution over html parsing continues.
In case of defer, the html parsing and fetching of script takes place parallely, but execution of scripts takes place only after html parsing is completed.
